Front end related thingys:

  use the "center" class that can be found in /focal/environments/styles.css
  to center things, it also adds a 40 pixel padding around the perimeter. There is
  also "nicepadding" that can be found in the same directory that just adds a 40 pixel
  padding.

  Weird issues bcs i suck and web devlopement. The create component in /focal/src/app/component/pages/create
  cannot be accessed for whatever reason.
